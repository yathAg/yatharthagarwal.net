Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Yatharth Agarwal, a PhD Candidate at Purdue University, where I'm delving into the exciting world of developing efficient end-to-end systems for enabling inteligence on the edge by exploring the domains of VLSI, Embedded Systems and Computer Vision.

When I'm not buried in coursework or tinkering with circuits, you can catch me cheering my favorite F1 driver, immersing myself in the latest blockbuster movies, or getting lost in the pages of a good book.

Join me as I navigate the twists and turns of the tech industry and strive to make a meaningful impact through my work!
